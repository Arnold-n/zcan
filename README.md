Although this is a fork from the great work of marco-hoyer, the goal for this repository is quite different. My goal is to create a set of python scripts to monitor and actively control the ComfoAirQ units.

## Status
Mapping is quite complete, commands still need a lot of work.

Also there is no build system or anything, for now just a bunch of scripts.
